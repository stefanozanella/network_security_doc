% NOTE: The following line is a workaround to make inclusion of tikz work when
% compiling with tex4ht. For some reason, at the time the package is included,
% \Hnewline isn't defined and the compilation results in errors.
% It seems that adding this quick fix doesn't modify output HTML, in the sense
% that it still contains newlines in the expected places.
